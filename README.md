# ATMmachine-Interface
This is my Internship project in which I make ATM machine Interface with the help of core Java. This is console based project of java.
ATM Machine Code
This project contains the code for an ATM machine. The code is written in Java and is designed to be run on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

To install the ATM machine code, you will need to follow these steps:

Download the code from the GitHub repository.
Ensure that you have Java 8 or higher installed on your system.
Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where the code is located.
Compile the code using the following command: javac *.java
Run the code using the following command: java ATM
Usage
Once the code is installed, you can use the ATM machine by following these steps:

Run the code using the instructions provided in the installation section.
Follow the prompts on the screen to interact with the ATM machine.
The ATM machine will guide you through the process of withdrawing, depositing, or transferring funds.
Contributing
If you would like to contribute to the development of the ATM machine code, you can do so by forking the repository and submitting a pull request with your changes. Please ensure that your code is well-documented and follows best practices for Java programming.
